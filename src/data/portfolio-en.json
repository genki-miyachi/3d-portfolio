    "lines": [
      "Started my career in automotive control software development, where automating tests improved efficiency by 20x — sparking a passion for solving real-world problems through technology.",
      "After transitioning to web development, I led the 0-to-1 launch of a recruitment management SaaS and a full rebuild of a legacy system. Over 8 years, I built a full-stack skill set spanning GraphQL API design, database schema redesign, and clean architecture adoption.",
      "I've also served as tech lead and scrum master for teams of 10+. Currently developing 3D simulation software with Three.js, while single-handedly driving a new SaaS from architecture design through implementation and CI/CD on the side.",
      "My driving principle is simplifying complexity — whether in technology selection, architecture design, or team building. Recently drawn to the intersection of WebGL/3D graphics and product development."
